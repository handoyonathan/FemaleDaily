# 🎯 Female Daily x JxB – The Jastipers

> A beauty expo shouldn’t feel like a maze.  
> Let’s make navigation, flash sale discovery, and crowd control smarter — for every visitor.

## 📱 Solution Overview

This repository contains the Proof of Concept (PoC) developed by Team 10 – The Jastipers – for the Female Daily x Jakarta X Beauty 2025 Industry Challenge.

Our mission:  
🧭 Help visitors navigate booths and access flash sale info easily in a crowded venue.

### ✅ Core Features Implemented

- 📍 Landmark-Based Navigation  
  Visitors explore venue zones grouped by recognizable icons (landmarks), replacing confusing booth numbers.

- ⚡️ Flash Sale Schedule Viewer  
  Real-time overview of ongoing and upcoming flash sales per zone.

- 🧑‍💻 Online Queuing System
  A concept feature to let users take queue numbers remotely to reduce congestion.

---

## 💡 Why It Matters

- 60% of visitors missed flash sales due to lack of alerts or info.  
- 40% of visitors reported feeling lost inside the event.  
- Average wait time per booth: 20 minutes — cutting into discovery and fun.

Our prototype reduces stress and boosts exploration by using clear visuals, smarter scheduling, and actionable tech.
